Libraries to use: ofximGUI, JSON for Modern C++, maybe something for sound or just import sounds, maybe some kind of map rendering library like ofx2DMapping for grid

Goals:
1. Basic JSON is mostly done from Adventure 2 assignment. I need to update it for the capabilities of this project
2. (Dropped) Thinking of either just using stock images of character models from the game or searching for pre rendered models on the web through some library (something like this https://www.models-resource.com/gamecube/legendofzeldathewindwaker/model/7795/)?
3. (Dropped) Or I could just get an image of the island and make that the whole background with the picture of link on the island the player model (something like this https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E1LA6W6HIz4/maxresdefault.jpg or this https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f2/23/9d/f2239d4fea5aecaaa3a3e4f1a8562c7d.jpg)?
4. (Dropped) Implement fighting system (health points, item attack points, upgradable health, replenishable health) 
5. Implement action box GUI displaying actions, descriptions, and current inventory
6. Grab game sounds and play certain island sounds when a player is at that island (copyright?)
