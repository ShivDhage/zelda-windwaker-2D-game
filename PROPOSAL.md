# Project: Extension on Adventure 2 assignment

I will be extending my Adventure 2 assignment to create a game with a graphical interface and sounds. The libraries I plan on using include ofxJSON for parsing c++ and ofximGui for creating a graphical interface.

 My adventure 2 assignment's JSON was modeled after islands and monsters from The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker game. 
 I wanted to create a turn-based game which displays the player's current possible turns on the screen in the form of a GUI. 
 I am thinking of generating a grid on the screen which has each island that the player can travel to on the grid, like a map. This will be the game display.
 So for example, when the player starts the game, he/she is at Outset Island, the player's hometown. 
 There the player is greeted with sounds of the island from the actual game.
 Messages are displayed in a box at the bottom half of the screen, but not covering the character. 
 This box will show the moves that the player can make and it can also show the current inventory of the player. 
 This box GUI will be like the one from pokemon games, where all the possible attacks and inventory is showed. 
 I am also thinking of somehow getting an image for link and making that the player model on the screen (not 100% sure about this). 
 For items that players can pick up, it can be modeled like in the actual wind waker game with treasure chests that the player can open and the treasure chest sound playing when the player correctly opens the treasure chest. 
 For monsters, I can try to do the same thing and get a picture of the monster from the actual game for the monster model on the screen. 
 When the player and monster fight, it will probably be too hard to get the models to actually fight each other so maybe whenever the player attacks, only a sound will be made but no corresponding visual action will be shown on the screen. 
 In my adventure 2 assignment, I created a very basic fighting system where if the player had the correct item, the player could 1 hit kill the monster. 
 I plan on creating an actual fighting system where each item has a certain amount of attack points and make even attack amplifiers when used against a certain type of monster. Also the player and monster will have a certain amount of health points. 
 Maybe the player can start off with some amount of health and either replenish it after fights with monsters with potions found or permanently increase it with health booster items like pieces of hearts found in the real wind waker game.
